filesystem hierarchy
linux distributions organize their filesystems according to the linux file system hierarchy (FHS) standard
too lee the top-level directories run ls -l /
/ this is the root directory the starting point in the entire file system

essential directories
/bon - contains essential command-line programs (binaries) avaible to all users such as ls cp mv
/sbin - holds essential system binaries which are primarily intended for system administration and can typically only be run by the root user
/etc - this is the core system configuration directory it contains configuration files for the operating system and istalles applications but it should not contain any ececutable binaries
/lib contains essential shared library files that system binaries in /bin and /sbin depend on to function correctly
/boot stores the files required for the systems boot process including the linux kernel and the boot loader files

user and application data
/home contains personal directories for each user this is where you store your documents application settings and other personal files
/root the home directory for the root user separate from the /home directory to ensure the root user can log in even if /home is unavailable
/opt reserved for optional or third-party applicaton software packages
/usr this directory contains user-installed sofftware and utilities despite its name it generally does not hold individual user's home files. it has its own sub-directory structure such as /usr/bin for non-essential user binaries and /usr/local for software compiled from source

dynamic and temporary data
/var stands for "variable" and stores files that are expected to change in size and content, such as system logs /var/log, catches and spool files
/tmp  A world-writable space for storing temporary files. Files in this directory are often deleted upon system reboot.
/run Contains information about the running system since the last boot, such as process IDs (PIDs) and other runtime data.

device and mount points
/dev Contains special device files that represent hardware components like hard drives, terminals, and input devices.
/media A standard mount point for removable media like USB drives, SD cards, and CD-ROMs.
/mnt A generic mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems.

system information

/proc A virtual filesystem that provides real-time information about currently running processes and kernel parameters.
/srv Intended for site-specific data served by the system, such as files for a web server.
