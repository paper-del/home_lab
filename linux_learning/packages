software distribution
in linux are a lot of softwares : web browsers , text editors , medi players
they are packages and they are managed by packages manager
package is an archive of files including the spplications executables
the software supply chain
upstream providers - these are the developer who write the software they compile the source code create installation instructions and release new versions and updates
package maintainers - when a new version is ready upstream providers send it to package mainainters these maintainers review manage and distribute the software to end-user in the form packages tailored for specific linux distributions

common package formats
there are two predominant packages formats
debian .deb
red hat package manager .rpm


package repositories
a package repository is a central storage location for softaware these repositories hosted on servers scross the internet contain curated collections of linux packages

how repositories work
you configure your package manager to use aplication official repository . once configured your system can access all the packafes within that repository

configuring reopstiory sources
linux distribution comes with a set of pre configured repositories for all the base packages on your sustem on debian-based systems
primary configuration for these sources is managed through the apt sources list
this list is a single file /etc/apt/sources.list

also common is the next repository configuration /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory to the third part repositories

tar and gzip
archiving is combining multiple diles and directories into a single file
compresion is the process of reducing the size of file to save disk space and speed up transfers
tar utility is used for archiving
gzip is used to compression

compressing single files
gzip file
decompression
gunzip file.gz

creating archives with tar (tape archive) .tar
to create a new atchive
tar cvf archive.tar file1 file2 file3
c - create new archive
v - verbose mofe which lists the files as they are processed
f - fiel which specifies that the next argument is the name of the archive file

tar and gzip combined
tar czvf archive.tar.gz file1 file2 directory1
the z is the option whitch tells tar to use gzip for compresion

extracting
to extract simplr .tar archive
tar xvf archive.tar
to uncompress and extract a .tar.gz archive in one command simpy add the z option again
tar czvf archive.tar.gz
x - extract files from archive
z - decompress the archive using g**z**ip
v - verbose mode listing files as they are extracted
f - file specifying the archive file to extract

package dependencies
in the world od linux software packages rarely stand alone they often rely on other components know as dependencies
in linux these crucial dependencies are typiccaly other packages or more commonly shared libraries

dpkg
to istall package in debian
dpkg -i package.deb
to remove
dpkg -r package.deb

list installed packaged
dpkg -l

and apt
these are paclage tools
installing
apt install package
remove
apt remove package
updating
apt update : apt upgrade
to get information about package us
apt show package

compile from source code
first install essntial build functions
sudo apt install build-essential
after instlling tools extract the contents
tar -xzvf package.tar.gz

the build proces standard
./configure
next
make
next sudo make install

a better way
sudo checkinstall
