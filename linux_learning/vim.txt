to start with vim we need to write "vim" in the terminal
or open file using "vim file.txt"

when you looking for some word or phrase use / comand in normal mode and write it 
vim will start looking for it forward
i recomended to swap esc with caps lock its easier to use and who use caps lock? 

in backword use ? 

when you want go  to the next match use n or previous N 


Navigation 

to move cursor you dont want use mause or arrows 

use instead 
h to move to the left
j to move to the down
k to move to the up
l to move to the right

this can be combined with numbers to move faster like
10h move 10 letters to left 

when you open vim you will be in the normal mode this mode is for moving  and writing comands and going to ther modes
if you want to go to insert mode use one of this shortcuts 

i - turs insert mode before the current cursor position
a - the same but on end of the current cursor position
I - turns insert mode at the beggining of the current line
A - turns insert mode at the end of the current line
o - create a new line below the current line and turn on insert mode
O - the same but create a new line above

you can too combine this comands with number 
first write 3a in normal mode next write sth and go to normal mode and vim will copy and pase this pattern 3 times
