linux file permissions are in first letters while we use ls -l example
drwxr-xr-x
d - type of a file
rwx r-x r-x
r-read permissions
w-write pemissions
x - execute permissions
- - no permissions

rwx is user(owner) he can read write and execute
r-x is group people in group can read and execute
r-x is others. Others can read and execute

to change permissions of file we use chmod command
in symbolic mode
u - user/owner
g - group
o - others
a - all
+ add permission
- remove permission

to add execute permission to user on a file use
chmod u+x file
to remove write permission to group
chmod g-w file
you can also modifie multiple permissions an once
chmod ug+w file

using numerical mode
4 -read
2 -write
1 -execute

to set permission set you need to add this numbers like all permissions will be 7
chmod 755 file
7 user 4 + 2 + 1 all
5 group and others 4 + 0 + 1

owner permissions
in linux every fiel and directory is assigned an owner and group
changing user ownership use chown (change owner)
sudo chown user2 file
changing group ownership chgrp (change group)
sudo chgrp group2 file

changing both use chown
sudo chown user2:group2 file

when you create a file this file automaticly gets a permissions to change this permissions use umask but umask takes permissions istead of adding
deafult umask is 022
umask 021
takes from user nothing
from group write permissions
anf others execute

setuid
-rwsr-xr-x
the s is suid permissions which give user permission set it allows the user who launched the program to get the file owners permission
modyfying suid
symbolic
sudo chmod u+s file
numerical
sudo chmod 4755 file
the s symbol in numerical is 4

setgid is like setuid but for group
sudo chmod g+s file
sudo chmod 2555 file
2 is the sgid

the sticki bit
is a permission settings in directory to not delete and rename files in only root user can do it
t represents this permission
drwxrwxrwt
chmod +t directory
this add this in symbolic mode
chmof 1755 directory
1 are the same as t
